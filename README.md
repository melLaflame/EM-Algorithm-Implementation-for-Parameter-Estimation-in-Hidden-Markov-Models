# EM-Algorithm-Implementation-for-Parameter-Estimation-in-Hidden-Markov-Models
This project centers on implementing the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for parameter estimation in Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). HMMs are widely used in diverse fields, including speech recognition and bioinformatics. The EM algorithm is crucial for estimating HMM parameters when dealing with incomplete or uncertain data.
