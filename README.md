## Hidden Markov Models Parameter Estimation using Expectation-Maximization Algorithm

### Overview
This project focuses on implementing the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for parameter estimation in Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). Hidden Markov Models find applications in various domains such as speech recognition and bioinformatics. The EM algorithm is employed to estimate HMM parameters when faced with incomplete or uncertain data.

### Project Structure
- **`HMM_EM_Algorithm.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of the EM algorithm for HMM parameter estimation.
- **`README.md`**: Project overview and instructions.

### Instructions
1. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook `HMM_EM_Algorithm.ipynb` to see the implementation details.

### Dependencies
The implementation is developed using Python and requires the following libraries:
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib [additional_libraries]
